# Welcome 7x by Mamluk on GitHub

7x is an API marketplace that provides highly available APIs for the data you need to build your web and mobile applications.

It offers a different value proposition from other API marketplaces and providers - you're not charged by number of requests per month 
or per day, but only based on concurrent requests per second.

It's early days and we're just getting started - visit https://7x.ax/catalogue to see our current API catalogue. Sign up, get your API key and start developing.
