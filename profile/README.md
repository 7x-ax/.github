# Welcome to 7x by Mamluk on GitHub

7x is an API marketplace that provides highly available APIs for the data you need to build your web and mobile applications.

It offers a different value proposition from other API marketplaces and providers - you're not charged by number of requests per month 
or per day, but only based on concurrent requests per second.

It's early days and we're just getting started - visit https://7x.ax/catalogue to see our current API catalogue. 

Sign up, get your API key and start developing.
